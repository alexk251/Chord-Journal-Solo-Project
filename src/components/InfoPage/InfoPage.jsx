      <p>This App was created to assist my students in learning chord progressions. One of the problems I face
        as a music teacher is that my students are always losing or damaging charts of chord progressions I write them.
        I also have to record myself playing the chord progression so they can play along without me.
        This app allows them to have a safe place they will never lose the progression and also
        allows them to practice without me recording them a backing track each time we learn something new.
        The students can also study new progressions on their own.
